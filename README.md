# Sage Combat Tag
This plugin was developed for the SagePvP Network's Bunkers gamemode. It was intended to be written directly into an existing plugin, **not** as a standalone plugin.
It's intended purpose was to prevent players from teleporting to their faction home while combat tagged. As such, it also implements a combat tag feature.

## Usage
